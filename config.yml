# Currently user must associate borders with borders' configs manually
# to do it user must go to be used .mesh file and find Vertices line
# All vertices described by 4 values {x, y, z, index}
# Index are set by Salome with the following logic:
#   1) Specific unique index is set to every corner point (like {50, 50, 0} and
#     {50, -50} in a square 50-50 mesh)
#   2) Specific unique inedes is set to every side ({50, 45}, {50, 2}, {50, -35}
#     will have the same index as they are all on the same side)
# Also this fourth index value in {...} is called 'edgeIndex' in Salome and
# can be seen there.
